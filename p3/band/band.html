		<dt>Lungs</dt>
			<dd>This album holds a lush, fairy-tale feel with its raw, powerful vocals and cascading melodies.</dd>
		<dt>Ceremonials</dt>
			<dd>The band's sophomore album, Ceremonials, holds a more religious tone than "Lungs." The religiosity captures both solemnity and ecstasy.</dd>
		<dt>How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful</dt>
			<dd>Florence + the Machine's third album has a maturity to its sound. It combines the fairy tale elements of "Lungs" with the Biblical themes of "Ceremonials" in a playful and breathtaking way</dd>
